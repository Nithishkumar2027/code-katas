# The soul of wit: reverse an array

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-3kyu-blue?logo=codewars)

No time for stories. Reverse an array, return the result. Do whatever you want with the original array. Don't use `Array.prototype.reverse`.

You have **30 bytes** to spare.

### Example

```js
[1, 2, 3] â†’ [3, 2, 1]
```

And this time you won't be able to do the thing from that kata.

require isn't allowed as well.
