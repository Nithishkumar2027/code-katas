# One Line Task: Check Range

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-3kyu-blue?logo=codewars)

You're given an array of integers `a` and two integers `x` and `y`. Count the number of elements in the array such that `x ≤ a[i] ≤ y`, where i is the 0-based index of the element.

### Code limit

Less than `48` characters.

### Example

For `a = [2, 5, 6, 7, 1, 3, 4, 11, 56, 49]`, `x = 1` and `y = 7`,

the output should be `7`.

elements `2, 5, 6, 7, 1, 3, 4` should be counted.
